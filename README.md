### **_Description_**

I am an avid dungeon master and creator of worlds. I love playing a variety of tabletop roleplaying games (TTRPGs) and have always come across the problem of not being able to organize the information of the world in a well managed collection. There are a variety of tools out there such as WorldAnvil, Kanka, Fandom, yet none of them have the customizability that I desire.

This app, the Crystal Wiki, is designed to be the perfect malleable tool for any aspiring GM or avid world builder to sort and dictate their world as they see fit. It will have the functionality to dynamically add in new articles and categories as well as create users with various permissions, allowing them to apply CRUD functionality to features an administrator allows.
